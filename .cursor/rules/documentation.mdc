# Code Documentation

When adding or modifying Java code in this project:

1. **Class-level**: Add a Javadoc comment explaining what the class does and when it's used.
2. **Helper/utility methods**: Add a brief Javadoc explaining purpose, parameters, and return value.
3. **Public API**: Document behavior, side effects, and when to call (e.g. "Call markDirty() after modifying").
4. **Non-obvious logic**: Add inline comments for complex or subtle behavior.

Keep comments concise and useful—explain the "why" when it's not obvious from the code.
